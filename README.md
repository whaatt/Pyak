Scraping Yik Yak For Fun

### Overview
Yik Yak currently has a private API. This repository is an attempt to provide a public, open-source Python wrapper to their service. It is by no means complete or even guaranteed to be working, and at the moment, these scripts are more or less read-only. If you plan to fork and use this library, please exercise good judgment and courtesy toward the system administrators.

### Project
My research project into anonymous social media made copious use of this library. Please see the `project` subdirectory for the relevant scripts; running those scripts from within that directory should produce the appropriate output in `project/data` if everything has been configured correctly.

### Attribution
Pyak was forked from joseph346 in June 2014 and has been maintained by various individuals in the hackathon community. Your contributions are welcome.
