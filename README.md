Hacking Yik Yak for fun.

### Overview
Yik Yak currently has a private API. This repository is an attempt to provide a public, open-source API wrapper to their service that you can use easily through Python. It is by no means complete or even guaranteed to be working. The old maintainer of this repository decided to take this down out of courtesy to Yik Yak, but I decided to quietly and respectfully maintain this repository for personal use. If this has been released to the public again, the API here might be outdated, and I already know that posting stuff does not work.

### Attribution
Pyak was forked from joseph346 in June 2014 and Jared Smith sporadically continued maintenance and dealt with pull requests on this project. In October 2015, Sanjay Kannan began maintaining a local copy of the repository after Jared took it down out of courtesy to Yik Yak. Your contributions are welcome if this has been made public again.
