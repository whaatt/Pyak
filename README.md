Scraping Yik Yak For Fun

### Overview
Yik Yak currently has a private API. This repository is an attempt to provide a public, open-source Python wrapper to their service. It is by no means complete or even guaranteed to be working, and at the moment, these scripts are more or less read-only. If you plan to fork and use this library, please exercise good judgment and courtesy toward the system administrators.

### Project
My research project into anonymous social media made extensive use of this library; please see the `project` subdirectory for the relevant data analysis and collection scripts. For all of the statistical packages to work correctly, you might have to download a custom distribution of Python and create the virtual environment specified by the requirements file.

### Attribution
Pyak was forked from joseph346 in June 2014 and has been maintained by various individuals in the hackathon community. Your contributions are welcome, particularly if you are affiliated with Yik Yak and would like to voice any comments or concerns.
